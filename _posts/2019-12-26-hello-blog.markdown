A new set of resolutions are always the part of a New Year. For most part of the last decade I was in a rush to consume as much information I could, as fast as I could. This stratergy has been helpful to an extent but over time this has grown into mindless consumption with very less retention. Often I agressively skim through materials and find myself unable to explain it to anybody else later. So this year the goal is to make an effort to take detailed notes on eveything I learn and summarise them here in this journal/blog.
